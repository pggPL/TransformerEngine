    "Precision debug tools for the Transformer Engine use [Nvidia-DLFramework-Inspect](0) package from NVIDIA. Here, we provide brief information on how to use it with TE. Full documentation of this tool can be found [here](0).\n",

    "- **config_file** (*str*, default=\"\"): Path to the `config.yaml` file containing features to enable and layer names. If one wants to run without the config file, pass `\"\"`.\n",
    "- **feature_dirs** (*List[str] | str*): List of directories containing features to load and register. One needs to pass `[/path/to/transformerengine/transformer_engine/debug/features]` to use TE features.\n",
